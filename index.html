			<p>Hi everyone! I am a web developer working out of Burlington, Vermont. I am currently studying for my
				Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at the University of Vermont and graduating in May of 2019.
			</p>
			<p>
				A lot of my computing knowledge comes from my classwork at UVM, and general knowledge from my interest
				and usage of computers throughout my life. However, the large majority of my real-world programming
				experience has been at the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation as a Web Development Intern. During
				my time there, I have familiarized myself with the Model View Controller project design while
				working on Java applications within the Grails framework. A lot of the work I did was application
				fixes to satisfy the needs of both internal and end users of MyVSAC.
